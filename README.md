# Offsite Payments

[![Build Status](https://github.com/sealink/offsite_payments_poli_pay/workflows/Build%20and%20Test/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/sealink/offsite_payments_poli_pay/actions)

Offsite Payments is an extraction from the ecommerce system [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com). Shopify's requirements for a simple and unified API to handle dozens of different offsite payment pages (often called hosted payment pages) with very different exposed APIs was the chief principle in designing the library.

It was developed for usage in Ruby on Rails web applications and integrates seamlessly
as a Rails plugin. It should also work as a stand alone Ruby library, but much of the benefit is in the ActionView helpers which are Rails-specific.

This gem provides integration for [POLi Payments](https://www.polipayments.com/)
through the Offsite Payments gem.
